<br/><br/>

A Lens Studio project for procedural planet generation using the Shader Graph Editor (.lso, project)!

Has a nice UI and some cool features!
The main script contains some useful functons, like a linear to cubic converter, a random number generator with normal (bell curve) distribution, and some good examples of how to combine script and Shader Graph.
